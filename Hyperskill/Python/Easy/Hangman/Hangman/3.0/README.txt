Stage 3/8: Make your choice

Description
If there is a predefined word, the game isn't replayable. You already know the word, so thereâ€™s no longer any challenge. At this stage, let's make the game more challenging by choosing a word from a special list with a variety of options. This way, our game will have more replay value.

Objectives
Create the following list of words: 'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'.
Program the game to choose a word from the list at random. You can enter more words, but let's stick to these four for now.
