Stage 6/8: The value of life
Description
The most recent version of the game is not so much fun, since we still don’t have a way to handle the player's victory. The player has 8 attempts to guess letters, and the number of remaining attempts decreases after each try even if the player guesses correctly.

In this next version, a player may get a lot of attempts because they are limited only by the number of mistakes they make. A player can be mistaken 8 times. They win when they have guessed all the letters and still have at least one try. If the player uses their last try and actually guesses the word, then they’ve won!

Objectives
The player starts the game with 8 "lives", which is to say, our player can input a wrong letter 8 times.

Print That letter does not appear in the word and reduce the number of remaining attempts if the word selected by the program doesn't contain this letter.
Print No improvements and reduce the attempts count if the selected word contains this letter but the user has already tried guessing it.
The number of remaining attempts should be decreased only if there are no letters to uncover.
Please, make sure that your program's output formatting precisely follows the output formatting in the example. Pay attention to the empty lines between tries and at the end.
